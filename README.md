## Database Implementation
- The implementation of the database is the important step in designing systems, so you start to ask what the RDBMS that I will use?? and Which one is better?.
- You have to choose the right RDBMS that will serve the business and your customers.
- I used SQLServer RDBMS and created the database using wizard in SSMS and creating tables using SQL queries.
- I created constraint and relations on database using SQL.
- Last thing is running the database diagram from SSMS
